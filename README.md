# Markov Random Fields Explained

This repository includes some homemade lectures for the people who are approching the study of Conditional Random Fields and Markov Random Fields, so already having some preliminary background ( Probability, Statistics,  MCMC, Gibbs Sampling, Maximum Likelihood Estimantion, Maximum A Posteriori, and so on) but have some missing points to put all together. 

What I'd like to do here is to take some articles and explain them step by step, without giving anything granted. I would like to explain all the reasoning of how the problems have been approached.
